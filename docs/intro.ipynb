    "`neurodiffeq` is a package for solving differential equations with neural networks. Differential equations are equations that relate some function with its derivatives. They emerge in various scientific and engineering domains. Traditionally these problems can be solved by numerical methods (e.g. finite difference, finite element). While these methods are effective and adequate, their solutions are discrete. It would be interesting if we can compute solutions for differential equations that are continuous and differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As universal function approximators, artificial neural networks have been shown to have the potential to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) with certain initial/boundary conditions. The aim of `neurodiffeq` is to implement these existing techniques of using ANN to solve differential equations in a way that allow the software to be flexible enough to work on a wide range of user-defined problems.\n",

    "## Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential equations can be divided into 2 types: ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordinary Differential Equations\n",
    "An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an differential equation that contains only one independent variable (a scalar). Let $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be the independent variable and $x(t): \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ be a function of $t$. An ordinary differential equation of order $n$ takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(t, x, \\frac{dx}{dt}, \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}, \\ldots, \\frac{d^nx}{dt^n}) = 0,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A general solution of an $n$th-order equation is a solution containing $n$ arbitrary independent constants of integration. A particular solution is derived from the general solution by setting the constants to particular values. This is often done by imposing an initial condition or boundary condition to the ODE. The former corresponds to an initial value problem (IVP) and the latter a boundary value problem (BVP).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Value Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following ODE: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(t, x, \\frac{dx}{dt}, \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}, \\ldots, \\frac{d^nx}{dt^n}) = 0,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we specify that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t_0) = x_0,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then we have an initial value problem. Initial value problem can be seen as the question of how $x$ will evolve with time given $x=x_0$ at time $t=t_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boundary Value Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "A boundary value problem has conditions specified at the boundaries of the independent variables. In the context of ordinary differential equations, a boundary problem is one that put some restrictions on $x$ at the initial $t$ and final $t$. There are several kinds of boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following ODE: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(t, x, \\frac{dx}{dt}, \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}, \\ldots, \\frac{d^nx}{dt^n}) = 0,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we specify that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t_{ini}) = f, \\\\\n",
    "x(t_{fin}) = g,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then we have a Dirichlet boundary condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we specify that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{t = t_{ini}} = f, \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{t = t_{fin}} = g,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then we have a Neumann boundary condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we specify that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t_{ini}) + \\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{t = t_{ini}} = f, \\\\\n",
    "x(t_{fin}) + \\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{t = t_{fin}} = g,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then we have a Robin boundary condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary conditions of mixed types can also be specified on a different subset of the boundaries (In this case, that will be one boundary condition for $t = t_{ini}$ and another boundary condition of a different type for $t = t_{fin}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### System of Ordinary Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of coupled differential equations form a system of equations. Let $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be the independent variable and $\\vec{x}(t): \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R^m}$ be a function of $t$. A system of ordinary differential equations of order $n$ takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(t, \\vec{x}, \\frac{d\\vec{x}}{dt}, \\frac{d^2\\vec{x}}{dt^2}, \\ldots, \\frac{d^n\\vec{x}}{dt^n}) = \\vec{0},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be written in matrix form as \n",
