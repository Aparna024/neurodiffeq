    "Where $\\vec{p}$ are the weights of the neural network and $\\tilde{x(\\vec{p}, t)}$ is the modified output of the neural network. How it is modified will be explained in the next section. We can see that when this objective function is driven to 0, then the equation is satisfied. "

    "To solve an ODE, our neural network will have 1 input unit and 1 output unit to approximate an $\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ function. Suppose the output of the neural network is $x(\\vec{p}, t)$. The output of the neural network won't satisfy the initial/boundary condition unless we enforce the form of our solution. For example, for a initial value problem where we want $x(t)\\bigg|_{t = t_0} = x_0$. We can write our solution in the form of\n",
